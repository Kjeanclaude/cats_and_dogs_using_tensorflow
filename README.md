Cats and Dogs (using TensorFlow backend for Keras)
==================================================

This notebook gives a quick demonstration of how to convert Keras models and pretrained
weights built using the Theano Keras backend, to TensorFlow.

It is builds on material developed in the *awesome* free online course:

Practical Deep Learning for Coders (Part 1) [http://course.fast.ai/]
